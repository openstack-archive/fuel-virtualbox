osx-nat-pf
==========

This script (osx-nat-pf.sh) could be used to enable routing and NAT for Admin
network (10.20.0.0/24) in Mac OSX 9 (Yosemite) or Mac OSX 10 (El Capitan). The
previous versions of Mac OSX use 'ipfw' so another solution should be used.

This script could be used for debugging purposes and uses an administrative
permissions, so you need to enter the administrator password on request.
